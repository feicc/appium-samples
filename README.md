Appetize.io Appium Samples
==========================

Appium test scripts can be written in many languages. These test scripts are written in NodeJS.

To install NodeJS, please see https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/. Our preferred method on Mac OSX is to use Homebrew. Install Homebrew by following directions at http://brew.sh/, then you may run `brew install node`.

These test scripts depend on a few packages which are referenced in the file package.json. To install the packages listed in package.json, you may cd to this directory in Terminal and run `npm install`.

You may now run any of the included sample scripts by running `node filename.js`, for example, `node android-simple.js`.

For further questions, please see our documentation at https://appetize.io/docs.
